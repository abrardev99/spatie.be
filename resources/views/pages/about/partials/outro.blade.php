                    We design, build and support websites, webshops or applications —since 2004.

                    We try to focus on analysis, clear-cut advice and solid technology more than on fads of the moment. Our sites are built following modern standards, and optimized for performance on all types of devices.

                    Open source work is valued very much. Almost every aspect of our job builds upon the work of others.
                    We try to give back and release our own code to the community whenever it's possible.

                    There is a strong mentality to stay on top of things: through Slack, in-house presentations or conferences.
                    A part of our workload is dedicated to open source and side projects.
                    You can spot team members in user groups or as conference speakers as well.

                <em>Spatie</em> is Dutch for <em>space</em>, the character between 2 words.
